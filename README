iri-tests
===============

A collection of URI and IRI strings useful for testing 
processing in user-agents or other URL parsers.

1) iris.xml
The main file containing the Webkit tests in XML form.  
Also combines other test cases from various sources [1][2].
Also includes the expected results of parsing.  In addition,
some other files will be  produced for specific contexts:

miris.xml - Modified iris.xml with hostnames to help correlate
URL parsing across DNS queries, HTTP requests, and the DOM.

iris.txt - An attempt to store test URIs/IRIs in a plain text file,
one per line.  Expected results will not be stored.

tests.xml - DEPRECATED.  The original format borrowed from Julian [3].

2) gentcfiles.cs
Generate the test case files.  Parse the test cases out of Webkit's 
test suite [1] and store them in the XML formatted document named uris.xml.

To compile under Mono:
>gmcs gentcfiles.cs

To compile under Windows, from a Visual Studio command prompt:
>csc gentcfiles.cs

Requirements:
a) A subfolder named 'js' must exist with the javascript files from
Webkit's test suite.

Running:
There are no command line parameters, simply run the executable:
>gentcfiles.exe

3) TODOs

a) Expected results are questionable right now and will need more work.
Do not rely on them.

b) miris.xml needs complete

c) iris.text needs complete - should this use a UTF-8 document encoding?
If so it will not be able to store the illegal UTF-8 test cases.

d) BUGS? I've only spot checked the results, more review would be nice.
